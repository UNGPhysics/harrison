\textbf{Topic 2 Study Guide} \par
\vspace{\baselineskip}
}

The topic of vectors is a mathematical prerequisite for much of the remaining course content.
You will not be tested directly on vectors, but vectors will show up frequently in future physics topics.
Be sure you are comfortable with converting vectors to/from Cartesian/polar coordinates in all four quadrants of the xy-plane, adding/subtracting vectors, and scalar multiplication of vectors.
(Later in the semester we will also see dot products and cross products)
