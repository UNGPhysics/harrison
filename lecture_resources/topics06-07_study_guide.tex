\textbf{I. Things to memorize.}
On the test you will be given a blank space where you will be asked to reproduce the following information from memory.
\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}

\begin{addmargin}[1em]{0em}% 1em left, 0em right
\textbf{A. Definitions} \\
$\bullet$ Work: $W = \int \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{x}$, often it is sufficent to use $W = F_\parallel \Delta x$ \\
$\bullet$ Kinetic Energy: $KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2$ \\
$\bullet$ Power: $P = \frac{dW}{dt}$ \\
$\bullet$ Conservative Force: If the work done by a force in moving an object from point A to point B is independent of the path taken, the force is said to be conservative. Conservative forces can be described by a potential energy function. \\

\textbf{B. Units:} \\
$\bullet$ The SI unit for both work and energy is the Joule (J) which is equivalent to a $kg \cdot m^2/s^2$ \\
$\bullet$ The SI unit for power is the Watt (W) which is equivalent to a $J/s$ \\

\textbf{C. (Partial) list of conservative forces and their corresponding potential energy functions:} \\
$\bullet$ Gravity: $PE_g = mgh$ \\
$\bullet$ Springs: $PE_s = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$
\end{addmargin}

\vspace{\baselineskip}
\textbf{II. Proofs:} \\
$\bullet$ Starting with Hooke's Law ($F_s = -kx$) and the definition of work, show that the work done by a spring in moving an object from $x_1$ to $x_2$ is $W = \frac{1}{2}kx_1^2 - \frac{1}{2}kx_2^2$ \\
$\bullet$ Show that $W = \Delta KE$ by starting with $W = \int F dx$ where $F = ma = m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}$ and $dx = vdt = \frac{dx}{dt}dt$. Use u-substitution and let $u = \frac{dx}{dt}$ and therefore $du = \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}dt$ and the integral becomes $W = m \int u du$.

\textbf{III. Problem solving.}
There will be 1 or 2 questions directly from the HW and 1 or 2 original questions.
