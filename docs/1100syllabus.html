<b><u>Course Description</b></u> <br>
This is an algebra and trigonometry based introduction to physics and is part of a two-semester physics sequence that covers mechanics and electrodynamics.
The lecture is three credits while the lab is one credit.
We will spend approximately 2-4 classes on each topic (see below) and, in most cases, do a corresponding lab.
The exact pace of the course will depend on the overall skill level of the class and is at the discretion of the instructor.

<b><u>Means of Assessment and Grading Scheme</b></u> <br>
&ast; late work will not be accepted and will be counted as a zero.
<br><br>
<!--Exams will be announced at least one week in advance, quizzes may occasionally be unannounced.
Attendance will be taken at the beginning of most classes.
Arriving after attendance will count as an absence.
Two absences will be excused. <br><br>-->

<b>Lecture Grade:</b><br>
<!--Average of quizzes and exams: 65% <br>
Attendance/Participation: 20% <br>
Lab: 15% <br>-->
Throughout the semester you will have regular assignments and tests.
Be sure to check for announcements at least once per day to stay up-to-date on important deadlines.
Your lecture grade will be based on the weighted average of all of your assignments/tests.
As a simplified example, suppose your grades are: HW1 = 10/10, test1 = 15/20, HW2 = 9/10, test2 = 13/15, final exam = 40/50.
Then your final grade will be (10 + 15 + 9 + 13 + 40)/(10 + 20 + 10 + 15 + 50) = 82.9%.
Although a slight curve may be applied depending on the final class average, letter grades will be determined based on the standard 90+ = A, 80+ = B, 70+ = C, etc. <br>
<br>

<b>Lab Grade:</b><br>
Your lab grade will be calculated by the average of your lab report grades.
Letter grades will be determined based on the standard 90+ = A, 80+ = B, 70+ = C, etc. <br>
<br>
