<h2>PHYS 2211/2212 - Principles of Physics I/II + Lab</h2>
</center>
<br>

<b><u>General Information</b></u> <br>
Instructor: Dr. Nathan Harrison <br>
Office: Strickland 209 <br>
Email: Standard UNG email address (&lt;first&gt;.&lt;last&gt;@ung.edu) <br>
Office Hours: 10 minutes before and after class, final 20 minutes of lab, or by appointment <br>
<br>

<b><u>Required Materials</b></u> <br>
Textbook: <a href="https://openstax.org/details/books/university-physics-volume-1">University Physics from OpenStax</a> <br>
Scientific or graphing calculator <br>
Optional but recommended: ruler, protractor, compass <br>
<br>

<b><u>Course Description</b></u> <br>
This is a calculus based introduction to physics and is part of a two-semester physics sequence that covers mechanics and electrodynamics.
Calculus I is a prerequisite and Calculus II is a corequisite.
The lecture is three credits while the lab is one credit.
We will spend approximately 2-4 classes on each topic (see below) and do a corresponding lab.
The exact pace of the course will depend on the overall skill level of the class and is at the discretion of the instructor.
